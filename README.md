# whitepaper-lens

## Inspiration
The crypto world is an intricate landscape filled with a wealth of information, but often lacks transparency. We were motivated to create a tool that would dissect and analyze crypto whitepapers, making them more accessible and understandable for all.

## What it does
"Whitepaper Lens" is an AI-powered tool that scrutinizes crypto whitepapers against the stringent MiCA standards. It provides an automated, unbiased review, and presents a score indicating the whitepaper's adherence to the standards.

## How we built it
We used a combination of AI and web3 technologies. Our tool leverages the capabilities of OpenAI and Langchain code interpreter for the analysis, and utilizes Streamlit for building a user-friendly interface.

## Challenges we ran into
Developing an automated solution for something as complex as crypto whitepaper analysis was a challenge. Ensuring the accuracy of the tool and making it user-friendly were some hurdles we encountered.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud to have built a tool that not only makes crypto whitepapers more transparent but also contributes to making the crypto world more accessible. We're also proud of our tool's user-friendly interface and its effectiveness.

## What we learned
We learned a great deal about the complexities of crypto whitepapers and the MiCA standards. We also gained insights into leveraging AI and web3 technologies for solving complex problems.

## What's next for Whitepaper Lens
We plan to refine our tool further, enhance its accuracy, and expand its capabilities to analyze more aspects of crypto whitepapers. We aim to make "Whitepaper Lens" a go-to tool for anyone delving into the crypto world.
